      <h1> Kate Lynn Thomson </h1>
      <p>
        My name is Kate Lynn. I have a passion for many things in life, including neuroscience and yoga, with a MBA, a MS in Molecular Biology and over 500 hours in yoga teacher trainings. 
        I have really loved learning a lot about full stack software engineering, and am not quite sure which area I would like to focus on.
        I do enjoy the back end, behind the scenes almost game like fun to creating intelligent code. I also enjoy the visual experience of 
        front end development. A fun thing about me is that I consider my true home Hawaii, and I lived on O'ahu for 15 years while sailing around the islands with my dad and brother.

        I looked down at the board. "The <strong>point</strong> isn't to win?" I asked. "The
        <strong>point</strong>," <span>Bredon</span> said grandly, "is to <u>play</u> a <em>beautiful</em> game." He lifted
        his hands and shrugged, his face breaking into a beautific smile. "Why
        would I want to win anything other than a <em>beautiful</em> game?"
